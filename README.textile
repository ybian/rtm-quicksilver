This is almost a git clone of the same named project from "brianjmoore":http://code.google.com/u/brianjmoore/. The project link is "here":http://www.binaryminded.com/qsrtm.html.

h1. Why?

The main intention for me to clone this is to "fix" this annoying issue that I always meet: "locks up quicksilver when envoking":http://code.google.com/p/rtm-quicksilver/issues/detail?id=8

I found the lock happened when the plugin tried to get lists from RTM.  My fix is actually a hack which is good enough for me: I removed the get list functionality!  Personally I rely on the "Smart Add Feature":http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/smartadd/ to do all properties input, including the list name.

h1. Other tweaks

* Rename the action name as "Remember The Milk"

* Make the icon look nicer

* Build with XCode 3.2 and OS X 10.6 and include a pre-built bundle in the root directory

* Change "bltrversion" to a universal binary so you don't need Rosseta if you want to build by yourself.

h1. How to use

Download and double-click *RememberTheMilk.qsplugin* to install.  You need to uninstall the old version (in QS preference) first if it exists.

If you want to build by yourself, you need an API key requested from www.rememberthemilk.com.
